        <strong>From Twisters to Tornado Alley:</strong> Tornadoes aren’t just a weather event — they are a force that shapes communities, challenges emergency systems, and rewrites maps. With over three decades of patterns and pressure fronts, the U.S. remains the global epicenter of twister activity, offering a dramatic look at nature’s most unpredictable show

        <span class="big-t">T</span>ornadoes are among the most unpredictable and destructive natural disasters in the United States, swirling columns of air capable of leveling buildings, tossing vehicles, and reshaping communities within moments. Each year, they carve through communities, disrupt lives, and challenge the country’s preparedness infrastructure.
      </p>
  
      <p class="highlight-blue">
        But what do decades of storm data actually reveal? Is Tornado Alley shifting? Are storms becoming stronger, more frequent, or striking new regions entirely?
      </p>
  
      <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
        In this explorable explainer, we delve into more than thirty years of violent storm records, drawing from NOAA, FEMA, and global storm-tracking resources to paint a clearer picture of how tornado activity is evolving. From the heart of Oklahoma to unexpected outbreaks in the Southeast, the data shows emerging trends and surprising hotspots. By combining interactive visuals with expert insights, we aim to empower readers, emergency planners, and policymakers with knowledge that goes beyond headlines — exploring how climate, geography, and human response intertwine in the face of nature’s fiercest winds.
      </p>

      <p>What the data ultimately reveals is that tornado behavior in the U.S. is both consistent in its intensity and dynamic in its geography. While regions like Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas have long held the spotlight as part of “Tornado Alley,” recent decades suggest a shifting reality. Tornadoes are increasingly being reported in the Southeast, parts of the Midwest, and even extending into areas once considered relatively low-risk. This shift raises important questions about how climate variability, urban expansion, and atmospheric dynamics influence storm paths and severity.
        Tornado formation is deeply tied to geography: where warm, humid Gulf air meets cooler, drier air from the Rockies or Canada, creating the instability needed for supercell storms. But beyond meteorological ingredients, human exposure has changed. As more communities expand into storm-prone zones, the stakes rise—not just in terms of damage, but in terms of lives, logistics, and infrastructure. </p>
        
      <p>Understanding these patterns is no longer the sole responsibility of meteorologists.
        They are equally critical for emergency managers, urban planners, educators, and everyday citizens.
        Tornadoes don’t just reshape landscapes—they redefine the boundaries of vulnerability.
        In a warming and expanding nation, knowing where and why they strike is essential for building resilience.</p>

      As we zoom out to consider the broader narrative of tornadoes, it becomes clear that the story is not just about data points — it's about the lived experiences of those in harm’s way. The interactive visualizations above offer more than just geographic trends; they reveal the human toll of tornadoes across the United States. From the shifting hotspots of twister activity to the communities repeatedly caught in the crosshairs, one pattern stands out: individuals living in mobile homes face some of the greatest risk. These homes, often less structurally sound and harder to evacuate quickly, are disproportionately vulnerable during tornado events — a reality that underscores the need for targeted emergency planning and protective infrastructure. As you continue to delve into the data, consider not just the numbers, but the stories behind them. Each tornado is a reminder of nature's power and the resilience of those who face it.

          Tracks are color-coded using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale, where yellow represents EF1 (mildest) and dark red represents EF5 (most violent). The density of tracks shows the highest concentration of powerful tornadoes in states

        </p>
        <p>
          These storms are not just high winds—they cause lasting devastation. Over this 70-year span, nearly 1,000 people have lost their lives and more than 21,000 have been injured due to tornadoes in the U.S. Historic tornadoes like the 2011 Joplin EF5 (158 fatalities) and the 1974 Super Outbreak (30 F4/F5 tornadoes) illustrate the intensity and unpredictability of these events.
        </p>
        <p>
          As seen here, tornado risks have extended into regions once considered less vulnerable. This reinforces the need for advanced warning systems, resilient infrastructure, and community-level preparedness.

    <!-- Description Paragraph 1 -->
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      The graph above provides a snapshot of some of the most significant tornadoes in U.S. history, ranked by fatalities, injuries, and the millions in dollars in property and crop loss. These events serve as stark reminders of the destructive power of tornadoes and the importance of preparedness. As you explore the data, consider the human stories behind these statistics. Each number represents lives changed forever, communities rebuilt, and lessons learned. We suggest reflecting on the information provided and considering how it can inform future emergency management strategies and community resilience efforts.
    </p>

    <!-- Description Paragraph 2 -->
    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
      Building on the historical overview of tornado frequency and severity in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 delve deeper into the consequences of these storms, offering both a granular and systemic view of their human and economic toll. Figure 3 highlights the most devastating tornadoes since 1950 across four key dimensions—fatalities, injuries, property loss, and crop loss—reminding us that the magnitude of impact can differ widely depending on what is measured. Some storms inflicted catastrophic human loss, while others caused disproportionately high economic damage, exposing critical vulnerabilities in local infrastructure and preparedness. Vulnerability is multidimensional and context-specific, shaped by geography, land use, socioeconomic factors, and emergency response capacity. Together, these figures emphasize that tornado preparedness must be multi-pronged, accounting not only for storm frequency and intensity, but also for the varied and uneven ways tornadoes disrupt lives, economies, and landscapes across the United States.
    </p>

    <!-- Description Paragraph 3 -->
    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
      Between 1950 and 2022, the United States has experienced over 65,000 recorded tornadoes, making it the most tornado-prone country in the world. The central U.S.—especially regions within Tornado Alley—has borne the brunt of these events, with thousands of communities facing the impacts of rapid-onset storms. Tornadoes have not only claimed lives and injured tens of thousands, but also caused billions in economic losses, displacing families and damaging critical infrastructure. Events like the Moore, Oklahoma tornado in 2013 and the 2021 Kentucky outbreak underscore the need for continued investment in early warning systems, weather modeling, and disaster preparedness. As climate patterns evolve, understanding historical tornado behavior provides critical context for forecasting future threats.

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">Tornado Metrics and Long-Term Impact (1950–2022)</h3>
    <p>
      Tornado metrics across U.S. states from 1950 to 2022 show significant regional variation in magnitude, fatalities, and injuries.
      While tornado-prone states like Alabama consistently report high injury and fatality numbers, less frequently affected states still experience severe outcomes during major events.
      Tornadoes are measured using the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale, and even a single EF4 or EF5 tornado can result in catastrophic damage, regardless of the location.
    </p>
    <p>
      The increase in recorded tornadoes and storm intensity over time may partly reflect better tracking and reporting technologies.
      However, it also corresponds with growing population density in tornado-prone areas, expanding urban development, and possibly climate variability.
      According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), tornado-related disasters have contributed to over $100 billion in damages since 1980,
      with a sharp rise in billion-dollar weather events in the last two decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      This underscores the importance of preparedness policies, building codes, and community awareness programs,
      especially in vulnerable states and during peak tornado seasons (April to June).
